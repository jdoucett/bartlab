    <h1>Research</h1>
    <p>Our research  program aims to identify and address significant challenges toward the  ubiquitous use of uranium compounds for metal-mediated organic transformations.<br />
Some challenges  we have identified and are currently working on include:</p>
    <ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Well-defined  uranium organometallics are limited, especially those in low oxidation states.</li>
        <li>Understanding  of fundamental organometallic reactions with uranium is less well established  than transition metals, preventing broad application.</li>
        <li>The scope of  catalytic reactions currently demonstrated with uranium is limited compared to  transition metal analogues.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <p>We currently make use of a variety of tools to understand  and characterize our uranium compounds. These include paramagnetic 1H  NMR, infrared, electronic absorption, and X-ray absorption spectroscopies.  We also utilize X-ray crystallography and  computational methods to understand the bonding in our compounds and to provide  a complete picture of their electronic structures.</p>
    <h2>Project 1 – Synthesis of Low-Valent Uranium Alkyl Species  and Their Reactivity Toward Small Molecules.</h2>
    <p>Uranium alkyl species have been studied since the early  1970’s, and more recently, well defined species of all oxidation states have  been isolated.  Our research program  seeks to find the most efficient general routes to synthesize low-valent  uranium alkyls.  We plan to study the  reactivity of these species towards insertion reactions to determine their  viability for catalysis.  Further, these unique  alkyl species will be used to access uranium-element multiple bonds in attempts  to synthesize low-valent species. Studying this chemistry affords the  opportunity to study fundamental organometallic processes with uranium, which will  allow the development of a broad range of catalytic applications.</p>
    <p>The first organometallic uranium complexes generated in the  mid-1950’s use the popular cyclopentadienyl ligand, and since that time, this  ligand has enjoyed widespread use for supporting uranium complexes in a range  of oxidation states with various ligands.   Our actinide research focuses around a popular analogue of these  ligands, the tris(pyrazolyl)borate (Tp) ligand. Advantages of using this family  of ligands include their ease of synthesis, steric and electronic modularity,  and effective steric protection of the uranium center.  Previous work with this ligand on uranium is  dominated by the synthesis of uranium(IV) derivatives. In our laboratory, we  use the hydrotris(pyrazolyl)borate framework and its related ligands to support  uranium(III) alkyls.</p>
    <h2>Project 2 – Use of Redox-Active Ligands for Supporting  Uranium Species Capable of Multi-Electron Chemistry.</h2>
    <p>            Recently  the field of catalysis has begun a transformation, whereby chemists are  learning how to force inexpensive and abundant first row and early transition  metals to behave like their later precious metal counterparts. Success in this  endeavor can in part be attributed to the use of redox-active ligands, which  mediate low-redox potentials of first row transition metals, thus preventing  radical (one electron) chemistry and deleterious side reactions. These ligands  store metal electrons using the π* orbitals of their conjugated backbone,  enabling two (or more) electron processes by keeping the electrons accessible  for productive chemistry.  The result is  that these abundant first row metals can be used in applications which would  typically require precious late transition metals that undergo multi-electron  chemistry, such as rhodium, iridium, palladium, or platinum. Like first row  transition metals, uranium typically undergoes one electron reactions, as its  available oxidation states are +3, +4, +5, and +6, so utilizing these  redox-active ligand frameworks on uranium would offer the same opportunity for  this material to mediate multi-electron processes, allowing us to uncover the  true chemical potential and unique properties of this element for  organometallic chemistry.</p>
    <p>            In addition  to synthesizing these compounds, we hope to understand the bonding that occurs  between the uranium and this class of ligands.   For transition metal species, redox-active ligands form covalent bonds  by π backbonding of discrete numbers of electrons. Moving from the d-block to  the f-block metals decreases their ability to engage in covalent-type bonding,  and hence backbonding is not observed for the Lanthanides.  The actinides are thought to reside in the  middle of these two extremes, as 5f’s can more effectively participate in  bonding as compared to the smaller 4f electrons in the Lanthanides.  However, recent studies have demonstrated  that 5f orbitals are still too small in radial extension to be responsible for  true covalency, and it is in fact the 6d orbitals that are involved in bonding  through an accidental energy match of metal and ligand orbitals.</p>
    <p> Thus, with the help  of our collaborators, we are combining both synthetic and spectroscopic  techniques to make new compounds and understand their bonding and electronic structures  to accomplish fundamental organometallic reactions. Establishing the scope and  mechanisms of operation of uranium in its available oxidation states and  understanding how to induce multi-electron processes provides valuable insight  into the fundamental reactivity of uranium. Furthermore, understanding the  utility of redox-active ligands for these processes with actinides is central  to the widespread use of or</p>
